Hey Claude,

I applied for a conference happening in March 2025. The CFP I used is available at this link: https://sessionize.com/s/ossan/ocr-magic-in-go-build-ai-powered-text-extraction-w/156395

I put together the repo `pdf-chatbot` to help me in the content delivery.

The main technologies used are:

- Go
- Ollama
- vLLMs

The goal of this project is using OCR to query and extract information from a PDF masked as a PNG.

The journey has been:

- starting with a local LLM
- interaction with a local LLM via the `generate` Ollama endpoint
- interaction with a cloud LLM via the `generate` Ollama endpoint
- started to use the a local LLM via the `chat` Ollama endpoint
- here we faced a lot of problems:
  - images too big. We started by reducing the image size
  - ollama was not that verbose with logs
  - tweaked ollama settings
  - tweaked some model options to avoid hallucinations
  - tweaked the used prompts
  - cropping the image to the desired section
  - image resize via a 3-party Go package
- we were able to read super trivial PDF
- we wanted more
- tiling approach combined with cloud vLLMs

Everything should be put in a storytelling mode to emphasize inefficiences and difficulties.
Mainly it was due to the constrained machine I was using.

Be sure to leave time to introduce a bit the topics I'm talking about.

The session should be 40-minute long.

Can you provide the outline (slide-by-slide) of what I should cover.
Put some jokes from time to time and make fun of myself as well.
Leave some space for a recorded demo of how this work (ideally 30 minutes for each milestone).
I want you to be as accurate as possible.

My presentation style consists of frequent slide change. I prefer to keep each slide lean and focused. Don't want too bloat each slide with wall of text or plenty of concepts.
